#### About Me  

Hello :wave: I'm Austin Gebauer. I live in Seattle, WA. I'm a software engineer. 

I studied computer science at the 
<a href="https://www.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington</a>.

I'm  currently working on networking software for 
<a href="https://www.nginx.com/" target="_blank">NGINX</a> as a part of 
<a href="https://f5.com" target="_blank">F5 Networks</a>.

#### This Blog

This blog is an outlet for me to share things that I've learned with others.

Most of my posts will answer questions similar to:

- How does `X` work?
- How could you build an `X`?
- Why do we use `X` for `Y`?
