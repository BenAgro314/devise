#### About me  

I'm Austin Gebauer. :wave: 

I live in Seattle, WA. :umbrella:

I'm a software engineer. :electric_plug: 

I studied computer science at the 
<a href="https://www.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington</a>. :cherry_blossom:

I'm  currently working on networking software for 
<a href="https://www.nginx.com/" target="_blank">NGINX</a> as a part of 
<a href="https://f5.com" target="_blank">F5 Networks</a>. :wrench:

#### This blog

I love to find out how things work at a deep level. 

I love to share what I've learned in simple, cohesive writing.

This blog is an outlet for me to do just that.

Most of my posts will answer questions similar to:

- How does `X` work?
- How could you build `X`?
- Why do we use `X` for `Y`?
